## Course Description

Angular was designed by Google to address challenges programmers face building complex, single-page applications. This JavaScript platform provides a solid core of web functionality, letting you take care of the design and implementation details. In this course, Justin Schwartzenberger introduces you to the essentials of this "superheroic" platform, including powerful features such as two-way data binding, comprehensive routing, and dependency injection. Justin steps through the platform one feature at a time, focusing on the component-based architecture of Angular.
